# Final Result and Testing Examples

## *Note:* 
Please disregard the *test_HW2.py* file as it is outdated. I wasn't sure how to unit test variable inputs where the input parameter is a file / paragraph of text, and the expected output is usually a HTML formatted string instead of something simple like status update or a number.<br>

What I have done to demonstrate my project is first show what the UI looks like, then show the outputs of each of the API's functions.
